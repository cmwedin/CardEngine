# Type Scriptable Object
this scriptable object is used to store information about what types a card will have before it is instantiated as a game object using the data in its scriptable object. This system uses an entity component system to model different card types rather than an inheritance system as the prior is more extendable (e.g. cards with multiple types such as, to use an example from the popular card game Magic the Gathering, a Land Creature). Every TypeSO has a monobehaviour with the same name as it that is added to a card game object as a component when the card loads its data from a scriptable object. This monobehaviour stores information specific to that type such as the attack and defense of a creature, whereas the Card monobehaviour component only stores information all card have such as name, card text, and card image.
