## Card ECS model
This **in development** unity package provides pre-made architecture for modeling cards in the style of an entity component system. To elaborate consider an example from the popular card game Magic the Gathering (MTG). In this game cards can have a type such as creature, land and sorcery. The exact rules of how these "card types" work isn't relevant for this example, just that they behave differently in the game. While the exact mechanical behavior of such card types can differ widely across games, this type of behavior is common among card games. I will not go into detail for them but other popular examples include Hearthstone and Slay the Spire.  

In this package we model cards in unity through a [Card](https://github.com/cmwedin/CardEngine/blob/main/Runtime/Cards/Card.cs) MonoBehaviour on unity game objects. This MonoBehaviour contains general information all cards have in common, such as a name, image, or description text (more specifically it contains references to TextMeshPro ui components on which to display this information, the data itself is stored in scriptable objects but we will discus those later). Additional card types then have their behaviours represented in further components. Using the example above from MTG, if a cards data has the type "creature" the game object entity would have an additional monobehaviour component added to it representing that type, which would have additional data such as power and toughness.       

I will note here that this package attempts to be as agnostic of systems of the game it might be used in as possible. As such it is expected that the end user will write there own extension wrapping the Card class to suit the needs of their project. This package also currently does not provide any pre-made card types, simply the systems for the end user to attach their own and represent card data.
## Card Data
This package uses scriptable objects to separate the data of a particular card from the general monobehaviour used to model all cards. The definition of these objects is found in the [CardSO](https://github.com/cmwedin/CardEngine/blob/main/Runtime/SOClasses/CardSO.cs) class, with more details in the [documentation file](https://github.com/cmwedin/CardEngine/blob/main/Documentation%7E/ScriptableObjects/CardSO.md). Again we presume you will inherit from this class to extend it with the information needed to suit the needs of your project, however an option in the create asset menu is provided if you wish to use an unmodified scriptable object for testing or prototyping purposes. We also provide a scriptable object to represent the data of a card type, in particular the monobehaviour component they should add to a card with that type.
## Creating your own card types
The process for creating your own card type is detailed in the [documentation file](https://github.com/cmwedin/CardEngine/blob/main/Documentation%7E/ScriptableObjects/TypeSO.md) for the TypeSO class. 

This method is unideal as at is a workaround to an issue with my previous method of adding the appropriate type components from a cards data to a game object. In more detail, the scriptable object for a type would add a component with the same type name as it (the object itself, not the class defining it). This fails however as the definition of the type scriptable object exists in the package assembly, whereas the type the object should ad exists in the projects assembly.
